# Project
Regression Analysis Project
### Description
Used a dataset from Kaggle to perform regression analysis to find what different variables affect a TV shows IMDB rating
### Methodology
1. Used Excel to get regression outputs and removed the outputs with high p-values (insignificant).
2. Repeated that process until all the variables left were significant.
3. Once all the significant variables were left a final model was made to determine what variables affect a shows IMDB score.
